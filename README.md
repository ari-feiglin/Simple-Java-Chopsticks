# Simple-Java-Chopsticks
A simple chopsticks game, made in Java.

**The Goal:**

Make your oponnent lose both hands by forcing them to have 0 fingers (chopsticks) in both of them. <br />
A hand with 5 fingers is considered out, and it is considered to have 0 fingers.

**The Controls:**

Controls are simple:

Each player takes a turn doing one of two moves: Attacking or Splitting. <br />
Attacking: attacking with a hand adds the number of fingers on your hand to target command. <br />
Splitting: If one of your hands is empty (0 fingers) and your other hand has an *even* number of fingers, you may split that hand, and take half of the fingers and put them in the other hand. <br />

**Hand Numbers:**

Because I'm lazy, the left and right hands are numbered 0 and 1 (LEFT = 0, RIGHT = 1). Don't try and input Left or Right.
